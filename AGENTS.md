This is a sandbox repository. Its goal is to experiment with different architecture patterns and tools.

It mainly focuses on the hexagonal architecture and DDD principles.

When editing a file, never use comments, always meaningful names for functions and variables.

Always prefer a Functional Programming approach.

As the repository is using TypeScript, always type parameters and return values.
